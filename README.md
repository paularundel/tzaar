# Tzaar

Implementation of the board game Tzaar with Blazor and SignalR.

Game modes:

- Vs Bot (makes simple random plays for now)
- Pass and Play
- Online

Bot and pass and play modes execute locally in the browser. Online mode matching and play implementation is minimal.

Game can be played here: https://tzaar.azurewebsites.net/
